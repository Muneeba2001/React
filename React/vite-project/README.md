# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-Today Lecture:

- Difference between markup and markdown?
- linter and what it do?
- what package-lock-json do?
- What index.html do with App.jsx?
- transpiler: Which is converting HTML into JS and that's why we use JSX file name
- UseState have two variables in Array which are deStructured using Index.
- Anonymous Function

-TailwindCSS Lecture:

- Difference between NPM and Npx?

  > NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine. NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.

- Install Prettier ("https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier") from this link

  > After that create a file name (.prettierrc) in root folder

- Controlled and Uncontrolled Componenets
  > Controlled components rely on React state to manage the form data, while uncontrolled components use the DOM itself to handle form data.
